# Duviri Mood Clock

This version uses the chrono crate and applies my growing knowledge of how to extract values from Ok().

If you're interested in the developer notes, feel free to peruse the older commits!

I'm still learning to use Rust, so if you spot anything weird, please let me know via issues, or PR if it's especially egregious.

## Overall Goal

This will eventually be a webpage that can:
- display the information
- allow for users to suggest new seed time and mood, in case updates or game server issues changes the mood spiral schedule
