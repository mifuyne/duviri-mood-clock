# Duviri Mood Clock

## Overview

This version uses the chrono crate and applies my growing knowledge of how to extract values from Ok().

If you're interested in the developer notes, feel free to peruse the older commits!

I'm still learning to use Rust, so if you spot anything weird, please let me know via issues, or PR if it's especially egregious.

## Usage

The current iteration should be a web page, built with Vanilla JS.

## Overall Goal

This will eventually be a webpage that can:
- display the current mood
- display subsequent moods

## Future Goal

- allow the user to change the amount of future moods is shown
- replace the images with game-appropriate ones
- tests for deployment

## License

GNU General Public License v3.0 (SPDX: GPL-3.0-or-later)

At first I was going to go with the Unlicense when I was going to use primitives. But now I'm choosing to go with a more Rust(-ic? -y?) approach. There is more logic thrown into this than I initially planned as well.

This license *should* allow you to host your own version of the mood clock (in case something happens to my own version). If not, please feel free to correct me and make a PR for a more suitable license!
